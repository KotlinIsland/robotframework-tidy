Robotidy 3.1.0
=========================================

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==3.1.0

Tool consistency fixes
---------------------
Improved consistency of the Robotidy output. Now it should provide the code that does not
change after several reruns (`#360 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/360>`_)

Skip handling
--------------
Added skip handling to ``SplitTooLongLine`` transformer. Now it is possible to skip keyword calls by name or pattern.
For example, with following configuration::

    robotidy -c SplitTooLongLine:skip_keyword_call=Catenate src

All instances of the "Catenate" keyword call will not be formatted by ``SplitTooLongLine``.

End to end tests
-------------------
Added end to end tests to Robotidy. It should help with improving stability of the tool and catch some of the
bugs earlier (previously transformers were tested mostly in the isolation) (`#361 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/361>`_).
